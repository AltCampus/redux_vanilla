# Redux Counter

**STAGE 1**

Create a counte with three functionality i.e `increment` `decrement` and `reset`.

- Clicking on `increment` will increment the value by 1.
- Clicking on `decrement` will decrement the value 1.
- Reset will reset the value to 0

**STAGE 2**

Limit the increment or decrement value to be between between 0 - 10. Or else `alert` message saying the message.

**STAGE 3**

Make a additional set of button which will have 5,8,10,12,14,16 as values. By default the value to increment by will be 1. But when you click on one of these button like say (5). Now if you click increment it will increment and decrement the value 5.
